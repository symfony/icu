Icu Component
=============

This component contains data of the ICU library.

The bundled resource files have the [resource bundle format version 2.*][1],
which can be read using ICU 4.4 and later. Compatibility can be tested with the
test-compat.php script bundled in the Intl component:

    php path/to/Symfony/Component/Intl/Resources/bin/test-compat.php

These data are used by the Symfony [Intl component][2].
